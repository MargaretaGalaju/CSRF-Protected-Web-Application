## Theory :
One of the very dangerous attacks that an adversary can perform is a Cross-Site Request
Forgery (CSRF) attack. A CSRF attack allows the adversary to perform unwanted actions on
a web application in which a user is currently authenticated.

## Objectives :
CSRF attacks bring the most damage when executed by a logged user (especially an admin).
To implement mechanisms of protection from CSRF, you’ll first need to create a web application
that would allow a user to authenticate themselves. After applying the defence mechanisms of
your choice, you’ll need to show their effectiveness via a video. To summarize, you’ll need to:
__1. Create a web application where the user can authenticate;
__2. Implement CSRF protection for your web application;
__3. Prove the effectiveness of implemented mechanisms (via video).
